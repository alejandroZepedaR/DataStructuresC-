Paula and Danny want to plant evergreen trees along the back side of their yard. They do not want to have an excessive number of trees. Write a program that prompts the user to input the following:

The length of the yard.

The radius of a fully grown tree.

The required space between fully grown trees.

The program outputs the number of trees that can be planted in the yard and the total space that will be occupied by the fully grown trees.
