For each used car a salesperson sells, the commission is paid as follows: $20 plus 30% of the selling price in excess of the cost of the car. Typically, the minimum selling price of the car is the cost of the car plus $200 and the maximum selling price is the cost of the car and $2,000. Write a program that prompts the user to enter the salesperson’s fixed commission, the percentage of the commission, the purchasing cost of the car, the minimum and maximum amount to be added to the purchasing cost to determine the minimum and maximum selling price, and outputs minimum and maximum selling price of the car and the salesperson’s commission range.
