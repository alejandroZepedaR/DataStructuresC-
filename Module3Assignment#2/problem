(Apartment problem) A real estate office handles, say, 50 apartment units. When the rent is, say, $600 per month, all the units are occupied. However, for each, say, $40 increase in rent, one unit becomes vacant. Moreover, each occupied unit requires an average of $27 per month for maintenance. How many units should be rented to maximize the profit?

Write a program that prompts the user to enter:

The total number of units.

The rent to occupy all the units.

The increase in rent that results in a vacant unit.

Amount to maintain a rented unit.

The program then outputs the number of units to be rented to maximize the profit.
